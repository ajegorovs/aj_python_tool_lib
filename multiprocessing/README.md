there are good resources for CPU multiprocessing i.e https://superfastpython.com/multiprocessing-in-python/
but i wanted to create few usable templates in which i use async pool of workers for parallel processing.

Similarly, you can do computation on GPU. havent yet practiced with libs as numba, but i have implemented a template
using pytorch which is great if you have cuda core supported GPU.
